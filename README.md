This was a simple tracker made to keep track of challenges. I wanted some place to easily track the progress for things like 'arena ocean' or 'adapt to all situations' and thus made this. 

This was mainly vibe coded with chatgpt & gemini cli so :x

The script to get the champion images and name is that 'download_champions.py' file.
